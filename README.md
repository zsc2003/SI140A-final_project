# SI140A-final_project
ShanghaiTech SI140A Probability &amp; Statistics for EECS, Spring 2023.



# Course Project Description

- This is the final project of Probability of EECS SI140A, which has two parts.
  - Part I (**required**): Performance Evaluation of Bandit Algorithms;
  - Part II (**optional** as bonus): Monte Carlo Tree Search Mini Problem Set.
- This project can be done by a single student or a team with two students. Teams with three and more students are **NOT** allowed.
- Your team is required to use Python for the programming part. You will submit the whole solution (including source code, theory, algorithm, simulation result and analysis) in the format of Jupyter Notebook (Formerly known as the IPython Notebook).

## Notice:
The implementation for the bandit algorithms may have some mistakes and bad coding skills. An updated version could refer the link below. They have a lot overlap, but some difference for requirements.
